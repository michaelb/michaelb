### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, nice to meet you, but be warned  as I am a very limited edition. Handle me with care.

# How I am today ?

Great thanks.  And you ?

Comment: and that would be enough chitchat: I don't like to speak about meaningless stuff, we don't know each other enough yet for that

# You would like to show me something ?
Yeah sure (sigh) ...

Comment: most people ask me to fix stuff, I am kind of acostumed and will patiently listen, and probably help. I am merciless towards those would could have easily solved their issues by themselves though. Also don't appreciate if they constantly break my workflow.

#  What I have been doing these times ?
Well I have been working about this side project of mine. It's about this and that, does it sound interesting to you? 

Comment: I gladly appreciate the attention, however I will make sure not to overwelm people with information or enthusiasm because they asked such a question most likely to be polite.


# Am I free this weekend ?
Yes ! Are you doing something with the team ?

Comment: apart from a few non-time consuming hobbies (sailing, RC planes, kicker...), I spend my time in a relatively un-organized manner. If I have too much free time I'll start a new project.

# What I look forward to do once I have some time
Some projects in other languages (C/C++, Java, and more) to keep my skills up-to-date.

Project ideas:
 * Collaborate on KDE Connect / bluetooth connection
 * Auto-correct for shell commands
 * Vim plugin to run snips of code
 * ML project to interpret code, preferably language-independent (need to research LSPs)
