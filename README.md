### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, nice to meet you, but be warned  as I am a very limited edition. Handle me with care.

# How are you today?

Great thanks.  And you ?

Comment: and that would be enough chitchat: I don't like to speak about meaningless stuff, we don't know each other enough yet for that

# I would like to show you something
Yeah sure (sigh) ...

Comment: most people ask me to fix stuff, I am kind of acostumed and will patiently listen. I am merciless towards those would could have easily solved their issues by themselves though. Also don't appreciate if they constantly break my workflow.

#  What are you doing these times ?
Well I have been working about this side project of mine. It's about this and that, does it sound interesting to you?

Comment: I gladly appreciate the attention, however I will make sure not to overwelm people with information or enthusiasm because they asked such a question most likely to be polite.


# Are you free this weekend ?
Yes ! Are you doing something with the team ?

Comment: apart from a few non-time consuming hobbies (sailing, RC planes, kicker...), I spend my time in a relatively un-organized manner. If I have too much free time I'll start a new project.
