# What I look forward to do once I have some time
Some projects in other languages (C/C++, Java, and more) to keep my skills up-to-date.

Project ideas:
 * Collaborate on KDE Connect / bluetooth connection
 * Auto-correct for shell commands
 * Vim plugin to run snips of code
 * ML project to interpret code, preferably language-independent (need to research LSPs)
 * Create my own neural network structure
 * Planning optimization with travel time lookup and availability
